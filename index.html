    <h2>Descriptive Logics and Agendas</h2>

    <h4>Q: Who says that Emacs org-mode agendas and sparse trees can't behave
    according to the rules of descriptive logics?</h4>
    <h4>A: Nobody.</h4>

    <p>I assert that, by codifying definitions, and defining axioms and rules to
    org-mode tags and properties, custom agenda and sparse trees can be
    generated by the agenda dispatcher that obey descriptive logic rules and
    produce valid inferences.</p>

    <p>To that end, this project is an effort to learn from OWL2, Datalog and
    SWRL to develop a package for GNU Emacs.</p>

    <p>Should it approach a general usability and utility, I will consider
    applying to Melpa or Marmalade for inclusion.</p>

    <h2>Agenda Dispatcher: Functions To Consider</h3>

    <p><a href="http://orgmode.org/manual/">http://orgmode.org/manual/</a></p>

    <h3>org-sparse-tree</h3>

    <p>“An important feature of Org mode is the ability to construct sparse
    trees for selected information in an outline tree, so that the entire
    document is folded as much as possible, but the selected information is made
    visible along with the headline structure above it.”</p>

    <h3>org-show-context-detail</h3>

    <p>“Org mode contains a number of variables regulating agenda construction
    and display. The global variables define the behavior for all agenda
    commands, including the custom commands. However, if you want to change some
    settings just for a single custom view, you can do so.”</p>

    <h3>org-agenda-custom-commands</h3>

    <p>“Custom agenda commands serve two purposes: to store and quickly access
    frequently used TODO and tags searches, and to create special composite
    agenda buffers. Custom agenda commands will be accessible through the
    dispatcher … , just like the default commands.”</p>

    <h3>org-agenda-filter-by-tag</h3>
    <p>"Org also supports automatic, context-aware tag filtering. If the
    variable org-agenda-auto-exclude-function is set to a user-defined function,
    that function can decide which tags should be excluded from the agenda
    automatically."</p>
